Changelog
=========

v1.0.4
------
* Added rebalancing for internal nodes (was only leaf nodes before).
* Added key suffix compression, which allows more keys to fit inside internal nodes.

v1.0.3
------

* Fix root node corruption when inserting large keys.
* Allow database with non-default page size to be opened without requiring page size to be
  explicitly configured.
* Remove unimplemented node rebalancing for deletes and remove unnecessary node dirtying.
* Added experimental file compaction feature.

v1.0.2
------

* Prevent corruption of recycle free list due to high recycle rate and checkpoints.
* Add equals and hashCode methods to Database.Stats object.
* Restrict page size to be even. Doesn't break compatibility because odd sized pages would lead
  to database corruption anyhow. Supporting odd sized pages isn't worth the effort.

v1.0.1
------

* Index close allows active cursors now. The cursors will behave the same as if they were
  created after the index was closed. The index will appear to be empty and all modifications
  throw a ClosedIndexException.
* Added ability to rename an index.
* Added index rename and drop notifications.
* Database shutdown method works for non-durable databases.
* Added node rebalancing to reduce splits and reduce storage overhead.

v1.0.0
------

* First released version.
