Changelog
=========

v1.9.0 (2025-03-04)
------

* Bug fixes:
  * Fix query sorting against columns which are ordered descending or null low.
  * Add special checks for handling header corruption.
  * Throw exceptions when deleting files, except when the delete doesn't need to succeed.
  * Tests and (minor) fixes for opening the database multiple times.
  * Fix View Query implementation of argumentCount.
  * The generated join classes should only use the Nullable annotation when the joined column
    is part of an outer join.
  * Workaround an unknown bug in which the file lock close method throws an exception
    indicating that the underlying channel has been closed, when in fact it should not have
    been closed yet.
  * Strip off IPv6 scoped address from replication group members.
  * Prevent double rollback if local leadership is lost in the middle of writing a redo commit
    operation.
  * Fix a potential race condition which could delete a segment file after it's brought back
    into service.
  * Fix a bug when extending a term causes the contiguous range to extend when it shouldn't.
  * Force a checkpoint when converting to/from replicated mode.
  * Drop direct use of FileChannel because it closes down when the thread is interrupted.
  * Sync should work even when opened in read-only mode.
  * Fix sync race conditions when checkpoint is running.
  * The deleteAll method should operate within a transaction scope.

* Breaking changes:
  * Switched to the Java FFM API, and direct page access mode is always enabled. This change
    isn't really expected to be "breaking", but it's a major change. The FFM API is slightly
    slower compared to using the Unsafe class directly, and so TuplDB will attempt to use one
    of the Unsafe classes automatically by default, falling back to the FFM API when necessary.
  * Swapped checksum and encryption order.
  * Remove the PageArray.open method. It was only needed by a test.
  * Rename JoinedPageArray to SpilloverPageArray.

* New features:
  * Support complex query expressions.
  * Support derived queries.
  * Define newScanner and newUpdater methods which accept an initial row instance.
  * Define an optional Row interface.
  * Add a method for processing all the set columns of a row.
  * Allow Mapper to indicate if it performs any filtering.
  * Add rowType and argumentCount methods to the Query interface.
  * Notify when allocation using large pages didn't work.
  * Attempt to restore a corrupt header from one of the copies.
  * Define an explicit exception for checksum mismatches.
  * Support accessing join columns via dotted path names.
  * Add a Table method which returns the join identity.
  * Add leader state and failover JMX operations.
  * Remote API relies on auto-dispose features of Dirmi.
  * Give replicator threads a useful name.
  * Add a method to rebuild a database.
  * Support large pages when using Windows.
  * Make Transaction interface extend Closeable.
  * Add a map method for performing column conversions.
  * Allow enter() to be called on bogus transaction considering that exit() is already allowed.
  * Allow non-deriving expressions in mapped, aggregate, and grouped table queries.
  * Add the ability to concatenate tables together.
  * Add a Table.hasPrimaryKey method.
  * Add a Table.distinct view method.

* Performance improvements:
  * Don't hold the node latch the whole time when verifying large fragmented values.
  * A temporary database doesn't need the checkpointer running.
  * Don't issue a checkpoint when finishing an index build if automatic checkpointing isn't
    enabled.
  * Make remote decoding a bit more efficient by not allocating a temporary byte array.
  * Process pending transactions batches, reducing the number of latch acquisitions.
  * Fix a performance issue when leadership is lost during a checkpoint, caused by massive
    amount of hash collisions.
  * Speed up verification by using multiple threads.
  * Reduce the amount of time the Parker spins (and yields) before fully parking. Overall
    performance is just as good and CPU load is lower.
  * Skip over large value gaps when verifying or copying them.


v1.8.0 (2024-03-04)
------

* Bug fixes:
  * Fixed a rare deadlock in the recovery subsystem when applying an index rename operation.
  * Don't delete corrupt log files when opening in read-only mode.
  * Don't attempt to checkpoint a read-only database, which will fail.
  * Various fixes to the generated code for decoding rows from their binary representation.
  * Various fixes to the table predicate locking subsystem.
  * Index tables are now cached by their primary table row type to prevent conflicts when
    multiple versions of the primary row type class exist.
  * Ensure that the trigger for managing secondary index is installed when opening a table.
  * Fixed deletion of tables which have secondary indexes.
  * Prevent secondary indexes from being used when the corresponding table is closed.
  * Abort in-progress secondary scans when closing a table.
  * Fixed a deadlock when table indexes change.
  * Fixed a concurrent modification exception which can occur during a secondary index backfill.
  * The generated row comparator classes now honor columns which have null low ordering.
  * The generated row predicate classes check if a column is set when being accessed, throwing
    an exception instead of silently accepting null as valid.
  * The generated row predicate classes now support comparisons between columns with different
    types.
  * Reduced the amount of cached direct byte buffers that can accumulate due to the use of
    thread-local variables. A specialized cache is used instead.
  * Promptly shutdown any table-related background tasks when the database is closed.
  * The verifier doesn't attempt to check nodes which are in an ephemeral split state.
  * Fixed local host acquisition with respect to ipv6, as used by the replication subsystem.
  * Calling `View.isEmpty` now checks if the underlying index is closed, throwing a
    `ClosedIndexException` if so.

* Breaking changes:
  * The `load`, `insert`, `replace`, `update`, `merge`, and `delete` methods now throw an
    exception instead of returning a boolean value. The original methods are supported in the
    form of newly added "try" variants: `tryLoad`, `tryInsert`, `tryReplace`, `tryUpdate`,
    `tryMerge`, and `tryDelete`.
  * The `Table` methods for obtaining `QueryPlan` instances have been moved to the new `Query`
    interface.
  * Removed some classes and methods in the io package that cannot easily be adapted to work
    with FFM/Panama, but they're not needed anyhow.
  * `LatchCondition` is now an inner class, `Latch.Condition`.

* New features:
  * Defined a new `Query` interface which directly represents a runnable query. It can be used
    as an alternative to passing query strings to the `Table` class all the time.
  * The `Query` interface has a `deleteAll` method, which provides new functionality not
    available in the `Table` interface.
  * Added a `Table.map` method for supporting custom row filtering and transforming.
  * Added a `Table.aggregate` method for supporting row aggregation.
  * Added a `Table.group` method for supporting custom row aggregation and window functions.
  * Added a `Table.join` method which performs a relational join against two tables.
  * Added a `Table.view` method which returns a table which restricts the set of rows to those
    bounded by a query.
  * Added a `Table.anyRows` method.
  * Added new `Table` methods which act upon row instances: `cleanRow` and `isSet`.
  * The `Scanner` interface permits a null step row instead of throwing an exception. When null
    is passed to the `step` method, a new row instance is created automatically. Likewise, the
    `delete` and `update` methods of the `Updater` interace permit a null row to be passed in.
  * Added a `Transaction.rollback` method, which unlike the `exit` method, doesn't exit the
    current transaction scope.
  * The `Database.verify` method now checks for duplicate page identifiers in the free list.

* Performance improvements:
  * Binary search has been optimized by performing 8-byte comparisons instead of 1-byte
    comparisons.
  * The primary database cache now uses transparent huge pages, on Linux only.
  * Support the random access flag when opening mapped files.
  * When selecting an index for a full scan of a table, natural ordering of the index is now
    considered.
  * When two indexes are both covering, favor the one whose natural order matches the requested
    order before considering the total number of index columns.


v1.7.0 (2023-03-04)
------

* Bug fixes:
  * Don't truncate extra pages if there were any issues when opening the file. It might
    indicate a configuration error which will be detected later as indexes are opened up.
  * When replicated, cannot start checkpoints or tasks that depend on checkpoints until after
    the ReplController is ready. A race condition would sometimes cause a NullPointerException
    on the first checkpoint and panic the database.
  * Fixed handling of file mappings during a remap operation which caused live mappings to be
    closed.
  * When waiting for replication to catch up, double check the commit position at most
    once. Without this check, the database would start up much sooner, allowing access to stale
    data.
  * Queries no longer select table indexes which aren't available.
  * Guard against table indexes from being concurrently dropped when scanning with a null
    transaction.
  * Optimizations and fixes for table row predicate locks.
  * Numerous query plan optimizations and fixes.

* Breaking changes:
  * Removed the EntryConsumer, EntryFunction, RowScanner, and RowUpdater interfaces.
  * Repurposed the Scanner and Updater interfaces to only work with tables.
  * Reading from a closed/deleted index now throws ClosedIndexException or DeletedIndexException.
  * ClosedIndexException now extends DatabaseException directly.
  * Introduced an internal table definition version number, which can cause issues when opening
    up tables which were created in earlier releases.
  * Table query parameters follow a one-based argument numbering scheme now instead of a
    zero-based scheme. It's now consistent with JDBC.
  * Removed the ':' separator from the query specification.
  * Removed the Table view methods.

* New features:
  * Support remote database access.
  * Support table query ordering, which selects an appropriate index or performs a sort.
  * Support null ordered low behavior for index columns and query projections. The default is
    still null ordered high when unspecified.
  * Added a table close method.
  * Added more JMX operations, and enabled notifications.

* Improve utility of the suspendCheckpoints method by waiting for an in-progress checkpoint to
  complete.
* Don't reset checkpoint duration stat when thresholds aren't met.
* Depends on Java 17.
* Add an API for supporting relational collections of persistent rows.

v1.5.3.3 (2021-10-03)

v1.5.1 (2021-07-10)
------
* Add more utilities for decoding short integers and unsigned integers.
* Ignore interrupts during critical operations, preventing database panics.
* Prune empty nodes when deleting ghost entries. If this isn't done, then an index whose
  entries have been fully deleted can claim to be non-empty.

v1.5.0.1 (2021-06-08)
--------

* Introduce background syncCommit task, which allows peers to compact their log even when the
  database isn't running checkpoints.
* Support LZ4 compression with replication peer restore.
* When refreshing the replication peer set, must disconnect old peers before connecting new
  ones, to prevent possible false address collisions.
* Reduce object allocations and copies within the replication subsystem.
* Provide public access to the commit lock.
* Added a View.isEmpty method.
* Free up more memory when closing the database in case something refers to the instance for a
  long time. Usually this is caused by a thread local reference somewhere.
* Remove spare page pool and keep a spare page within each node group instead. This eliminates
  some contention when many threads are simultaneously compacting pages.
* Added support for proxying writes from the replication leader via a peer. Experimental for now.
* Added ability to check if current member is the leader.
* Boost the size of the replication writer cache when creating non-contiguous writers, to
  ensure that they don't get lost. When they're lost, additional hole filling requests are
  performed.

v1.4.4 (2018-06-30)
------

* Replication fixes: Cannot fully switch to replica mode until a valid decode position has been
  established, and fix calculation of commit position when replicating large updates. In both
  cases, an invalid log position could be used for recovery.
* More efficient loads for union, intersection, and difference views, when using the built-in
  combiners.
* Allow the Sorter.reset method to stop the sort when in the finishing step.
* Add sort methods which produce results directly into single-use scanners.
* Add a public Database.isClosed method.

v1.4.3.2 (2018-05-28)
--------
* Fix race conditions when skipping and counting tree entries as concurrent modifications are
  made. Subtrees might get skipped. https://github.com/cojen/Tupl/issues/102
* Fix potential memory leak when calling next and previous, introduced by the last fix. Cursors
  must be fully reset when reaching the end, now that frames are popped as late as possible.
* Fix potential stack overflow when iterating in reverse direction (previous) over a tree which
  is full of empty nodes. In practice this shouldn't have happened anyhow, since node merging
  is typically aggressive.

v1.4.3.1 (2018-05-19)
--------
* Fix race conditions in the cursor iteration methods, next and previous. Sometimes entire
  subtrees would get skipped over when another thread is making concurrent changes to the same
  region of the tree. https://github.com/cojen/Tupl/issues/101
* Sorter shouldn't split work with other threads which are currently being processed, since it
  interferes with duplicate detection. https://github.com/cojen/Tupl/issues/101

v1.4.3 (2018-04-14)
------
* Added maxCheckpointThreads option, which can speed up checkpoints.

v1.4.2 (2018-03-11)
------
* Fix temporary stall when calling the sorter progress method. The finish method didn't stop
  all the internal sorts as quickly as possible.
* Add feature to listen for when indexes are opened.
* Log events when running the verify and compact tools, and also allow the cache size to be set.

v1.4.1 (2018-02-02)
------
* Fix bug when using the new cursor registration feature. When the database is restarted,
  registered cursors could get lost, causing redo operations against them to be lost too.
* Honor the default durability mode when using a null transaction. Previously, when the default
  mode is NO_REDO and the transaction is null, a redo log entry would still be created. Also
  honor the transaction-specified durability mode when using the unsafe locking mode. Previously,
  the default durability mode would be used.
* Added support for two-phase commit, using the new transaction prepare and getId methods.
* Added a parallel external mergesort utility.

v1.4.0.2 (2018-01-21)
--------
* Fix bug when deleting entries from the largest allowed page size, 65536 bytes. Under the right
  conditions, the internal search vector pointer would overflow the 16-bit range.

* Added a dirty pages stat counter, and include internal index stats.
* Added support for direct I/O (O_DIRECT).
* Added a CRC-32C utility (to bridge the gap with Java 9)
* Added more control over file preallocation when extending the length.
* Files are opened with the random access hint by default, eliminating unnecessary prefetching.
* Improved concurrency with the introduction of a "clutch", replacing ordinary latches.
* Incomplete database restoration is now detected, causing an IncompleteRestoreException to be
  thrown when opening the database.
* Unpositioned cursors now throw a specialized exception, still extending IllegalStateException.
* The index exchange/insert/replace/update operations are now always atomic, even when using
  the BOGUS transaction.

  operations.
* Undo log fixes for fully mapped mode, for large transactions, for many open transactions, for
  large keys, and for large values.
* Fix various race conditions which can corrupt the node map data structure.
* Fix inline fragmented value calculation to consider that a remainder of zero means that no
  inline length field is required.
* Limit maximum key size based on the maximum entry size. With a page size of 4096, the maximum
  was 2026 bytes, but now it's 2024. Larger keys are fragment encoded as before.

  due to no space left on device.

v1.3.5 (2016-08-28)
------

* Fix handling of invalidated transactions, and defined a new exception type for it.
* Fix root node initialization for new trees when using fully mapped mode.
* Fix various replication issues.
* Fix race conditions when closing database.
* Prevent improper use of bogus transaction.

v1.3.0.1 (2016-04-16)
--------
* Fix for Index.load during concurrent node splits. It caused the load to falsely return null.
* Fix undo log node creation when using direct page access mode. The reserved byte was not
  explicitly cleared, allowing fragmented values to corrupt the nodes as pages get recycled.
* Fix shared latch double release when using VARIANT_RETAIN, which would result in a
  deadlock. This affected the Cursor.findGe and Cursor.findLe methods.
* Fix handling of Index.evict when encountering empty nodes, and lock keys as required by the
  transaction.
* Fix handling of index delete and recovery. Deleted index must be closed just like they were
  before recovery, to allow recovery to complete.
* Fix for deleting empty indexes which caused an exception.
* Eliminate overhead of zero-length memory copy when using direct page access mode. This
  primarily affected the performance of values larger than the page size.
* Allow node merge to propagate upwards for empty nodes.
* Ensure that compaction and verification visit all nodes, even empty ones.

v1.3.0 (2016-04-02)
------
* Depends on Java 8.
* Several top-level classes are now interfaces.
* Tree search operations rely extensively on shared latches instead of exclusive latches,
  improving concurrency.
* Fix cursor race condition which allowed split nodes to be modified too soon, leading to
  database corruption.
* Fix deadlock when closing database.
* Fix handling of mapped file shrinkage on Windows.
* More fixes for random search and add improve safety of frame binding.
* Added method to analyze index size.
* Added capacity limit feature.
* Added fully mapped mode when using direct page access and MappedPageArray.
* Added method to evict records from an Index.
* File sync improvements for Linux and MacOS. Performs directory sync'ng and F_FULLSYNC.
* Use JNA to access native I/O functions, eliminating extra system calls.
* Make Latch class a public utility.

v1.2.7.1 (2015-12-22)
--------

------
* Fixed reverse view range handling.
* Fixed compareKeyTo methods for transformed and trimmed views.
* Require that bounded views only operate on ordered views.
* Added method to count entries in a View.
* Exposed a few more utility methods.
* When using direct page access mode, page fields are no longer copied to Node instance
  fields. This reduces overall Java heap memory footprint.

v1.2.6.1 (2015-09-05)
--------
* Fix when using mapped files on Linux. Shrinking the database file would cause the process to
  crash when the file is accessed again.

v1.2.6 (2015-08-30)
------
* Counts stored in bottom internal nodes, for speeding up cursor skip operations.
* Added skip method which accepts a limit key.
* More failure handling improvements.

* Add basic AbstractCursor implementation.
* Merge custom redo and undo handler interfaces into one.
* Add checkpoint support to custom transaction handler.
* Provide access to transaction nesting level.
* Attempting to write into an unmodifiable transaction should not invalidate it.

------
* Fix snapshot deadlock when reading from the cache.
* Add support for custom transaction operations.
* Improved key hash function used by lock manager.
* Expose the WrappedCursor class.
* Added experimental direct page implementation which relies on Unsafe features. Modify
  the source using PageAccessTransformer and then recompile.

v1.2.2 (2015-04-12)
------
* Fix root node deletion when deleting an index.
* Fix memory leak when closing an index.
* Fix to ensure that undo log recovery tracks ghosted values.
* Index drop uses same code as index delete, eliminating complex duplicate code and
  inconsistent behavior.
* Minor thread-safety fix when performing database compaction.
* Created a package for low-level extensions.

v1.2.1 (2015-03-21)
------
* Prevent search deadlock caused by heavy eviction.
* Handle rare NPE when a non-root node becomes the root node during a split.
* Snapshot can read from the cache.
* Allow checkpoint when doing page preallocation.

* Increased small key encoding format from 64 bytes to 128 bytes.

v1.1.12 (2015-03-01)
------

v1.1.10 (2015-01-04)
------
* Fix race conditions in node allocation and recycling code.
* Minor performance optimizations for large values and for simple loads.

v1.1.9 (2014-12-15)
------
* Fix assertion failure caused by aggressive eviction before the very first checkpoint.
* Added simple verification and file compaction tools.
* Checkpoint and redo durability improvements.

v1.1.8 (2014-11-30)
------
* Fix for corruption caused by parent nodes being evicted before their child nodes.
* Stripe page allocation to improve concurrency.
* Merge extremity nodes less aggressively, optimizing for queue access patterns.

------
* Fix for temporary deadlock at the beginning of a checkpoint.

v1.1.6 (2014-10-11)
------
* Added support for a secondary cache. A secondary cache is slower than a primary cache, but a
  very large primary cache can cause high garbage collection overhead.
* Added method to delete a non-empty index.
* Closing an index no longer forces all the tree nodes to be evicted.

v1.1.5 (2014-09-07)
------
* New node cache implementation. It reduces memory overhead, garbage collection activity, and
  performs fewer memory copies when inserting records.

v1.1.4 (2014-07-13)
------
* Fix corruption when reopening database, caused by aggressive page recycling.

v1.1.3 (2014-06-22)
------
* Reduce the number of node compactions caused by leaf rebalancing, by requiring that an
  existing entry slot be re-used for the inserted entry. More aggressive rebalancing is
  possible, but it causes even more compaction overhead with little benefit.

v1.1.2 (2014-05-29)
------
* Fix rare node eviction bug which left it (partially) in the usage list.
* Cache growth is no longer aggressive, only doing so to avoid node eviction.
* Added cache size to stats.
* Defined new DatabaseFullException for non-durable databases.

v1.1.1 (2014-05-12)
------

* Target Java 7 only.
* Added support for cache priming.
* Various fixes.

v1.1.0 (2014-02-15)
------

* Improved performance of findNearby by encoding extra b-tree node metadata. Indexes can be
  rapidly filled with in-order records using a single cursor which advances to the next key
  using findNearby. This technique works with reverse ordered records and it allows concurrent
  access as usual. Indexes created in older versions will not have this metadata, and so they
  must be rebuilt to obtain it.
* Decode only 6-byte child pointers, preparing for future support of child entry counts.

v1.0.5 (2014-02-01)
------

* Reveal file compaction feature.
* Tolerate, but don't update, b-tree node metadata introduced in version 1.1.0.

v1.0.4 (2014-01-19)
------

* Fix defects when inserting largest possible keys.
* Added rebalancing for internal nodes (was only leaf nodes before).
* Added key suffix compression, which allows more keys to fit inside internal nodes.
* Enforce key size limits. 

v1.0.3 (2014-01-11)
------

* Fix root node corruption when inserting large keys.
* Allow database with non-default page size to be opened without requiring page size to be
  explicitly configured.
* Remove unimplemented node rebalancing for deletes and remove unnecessary node dirtying.
* Added experimental file compaction feature.

v1.0.2 (2013-12-22)
------

* Prevent corruption of recycle free list due to high recycle rate and checkpoints.
* Add equals and hashCode methods to Database.Stats object.
* Restrict page size to be even. Doesn't break compatibility because odd sized pages would lead
  to database corruption anyhow. Supporting odd sized pages isn't worth the effort.

v1.0.1 (2013-12-01)
------

* Index close allows active cursors now. The cursors will behave the same as if they were
  created after the index was closed. The index will appear to be empty and all modifications
  throw a ClosedIndexException.
* Added ability to rename an index.
* Added index rename and drop notifications.
* Database shutdown method works for non-durable databases.
* Added node rebalancing to reduce splits and reduce storage overhead.

v1.0.0 (2013-10-07)
------

* First released version.
