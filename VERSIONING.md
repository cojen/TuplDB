Versioning
==========

Tupl uses a four digit semantic versioning scheme, W.X.Y.Z:

* W - Incompatible API and database format changes. Upgrading an existing database requires a conversion step.
* X - Backwards-compatible database format changes. Upgrading an existing database is automatic, but downgrading isn't necessarily supported.
* Y - Backwards-compatible API additions and minor improvements.
* Z - Bug fixes only.
