/**
 * Defines a logical unit of work. Transaction instances can only be safely
 * used by one thread at a time, and they must be {@link #reset reset} when no
 * longer needed. Instances can be exchanged by threads, as long as a
 * happens-before relationship is established. Without proper exclusion,
 * multiple threads interacting with a Transaction instance may cause database
 * corruption.
 *
 * <p>Transactions also contain various methods for directly controlling locks,
 * although their use is not required. Methods which operate upon transactions
 * acquire and release locks automatically. Direct control over locks is
 * provided for advanced use cases. One such use is record filtering:
 *
 * {@snippet lang="java" :
 * Transaction txn = ...
 * Cursor c = index.newCursor(txn);
 * for (LockResult result = c.first(); c.key() != null; result = c.next()) {
 *     if (shouldDiscard(c.value()) && result == LockResult.ACQUIRED) {
 *         // Unlock record which doesn't belong in the transaction.
 *         txn.unlock();
 *         continue;
 *     }
 *     ...
 * }
 * }
 *
 * <p>Note: Transaction instances are never fully closed after they are reset
 * or have fully exited. Any operation which acts upon a reset transaction can
 * resurrect it.
