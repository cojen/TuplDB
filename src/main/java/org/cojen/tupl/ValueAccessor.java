/**
 * Accesses database values without requiring that they be fully loaded or stored in a single
 * operation. This interface permits values to be larger than what can fit in main memory.
 * When using a {@linkplain Cursor cursor} to access values, {@link Cursor#autoload(boolean)
 * autoload} should be disabled to prevent values from being fully loaded automatically
 *
 * <p>When making transactional changes through this interface, undo actions may require that
 * copies be made of the original value. Partial truncation of a large value isn't optimized to
 * reduce copying, but full truncation is. When possible, full truncation will reference the
 * original value instead of creating a copy.
